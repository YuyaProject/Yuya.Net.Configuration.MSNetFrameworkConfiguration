# Yuya.Net.Configuration.MSNetFrameworkConfiguration

This project has been developed to use the .Net Configuration system in .Net Framework versions. When you use the .Net Configuration system in a .Net Framework project, you should be able to add the .Net Framework configuration files to the .Net Configuration system. However, Microsoft has not provided a component for it. Our project closes this gap.
